# Algorithm-weed
i just learned about booths algorithm, so i made oposite of it.
It will take a large number and add over and over like we do in multiplication.
3x4 is 3+3+3+3
every time it does multiplication of 1 number it will print the sequence number.
Btw, its actually calculating square nxn

good luck having anxiety while waiting for number to get printed.
